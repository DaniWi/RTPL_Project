# Name
MathGame - a challenging MathGame


# Description

This program is implementing a challenging mathematic game with determination of the average solving time for the player. </br>
The user is asked for his player name and asked to choose between an easy and a hard level.
In the easy level the player is challenged with tasks containing math operations on two integer numbers in the range from 1 to 100. </br>
In the hard level the player is challenged with tasks containing floating point numbers in the range of 1 to 100 instead of integers. </br>
        
Overall the player has to solve 10 tasks whereby the mathematical operation (additon, subtraction,multiplication, division) as well as the two operands are chosen randomly.



Note: If the result in the easy level (only integer values) is a decimal, flooring has to be applied.
