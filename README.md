# Name
MathGame - a challenging MathGame


# Description

This program is implementing a challenging mathematic game with determination of the average solving time for the player. </br>
The user is asked for his player name and asked to choose between an easy and a hard level.
In the easy level the player is challenged with tasks containing math operations on two integer numbers in the range from 1 to 100. </br>
In the hard level the player is challenged with tasks containing floating point numbers in the range of 1 to 100 instead of integers. </br>
        

Note: If the result in the easy level (only integer values) is a decimal, flooring has to be applied.

Overall the player has to solve 10 tasks whereby the mathematical operation (additon, subtraction,multiplication, division) as well as the two operands are chosen randomly.

For each task the time to obtain the correct result is measured.

Finally the average time of the player for solving that kind of tasks is determined and printed. This calculation is done in SPARK.
